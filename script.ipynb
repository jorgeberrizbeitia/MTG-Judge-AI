      "- Question: Can I play Aven Interrupter on top of Flashfreeze to allow my original spell to resolve?\n",
      "- Short Answer: Yes.\n",
      "- Full Explanation: In this scenario, you can respond to Flashfreeze by casting Aven Interrupter. Flashfreeze is an instant that counters a target spell that is blue, and it goes on the stack above the original spell. When you cast Aven Interrupter, it will also go on the stack above Flashfreeze. However, Aven Interrupter has the ability to counter a spell, but it can only do so if it resolves before Flashfreeze. If Aven Interrupter resolves successfully, it can counter Flashfreeze, allowing your original spell to resolve. If Flashfreeze resolves first, it will counter your original spell. Therefore, the timing of casting Aven Interrupter is crucial, and you must ensure it resolves before Flashfreeze does.\n",
