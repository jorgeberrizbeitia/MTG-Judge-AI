During the cleanup step, players discard down to their maximum hand size, and any abilities that trigger at this time resolve. However, the cleanup step itself does not repeat or create additional cleanup steps. Kozilek, Butcher of Truth has a triggered ability that allows you to draw cards when you discard, but this does not lead to an infinite loop or multiple cleanup steps. The rules state that the cleanup step occurs only once per turn, and while triggered abilities can activate during this phase, they do not alter the structure of the turn or create new cleanup steps. Therefore, even if multiple Kozilek cards are in play, they will not create additional cleanup steps, and the cleanup step will still only occur once.\",\n",

The ruling states that the cleanup step occurs only once per turn and that triggered abilities during this step do not create additional cleanup steps. However, the references to rule 606.5 regarding loyalty abilities are not relevant to the cleanup step or the interaction of Kozilek's ability with discard effects. The cleanup step is indeed a defined phase, but the explanation lacks clarity on how triggered abilities specifically interact with the cleanup step and does not address the potential for infinite loops created by specific card interactions. The ruling should have included a more thorough examination of the rules governing triggered abilities and their resolution during the cleanup step.\\n\\n                Please try asking your question again, this time with clearer wording to help us provide a more definitive answer.\\n            \"}\n"

However, you can only activate Panoptic Mirror's ability once per turn. To achieve infinite turns, you would need to find a way to activate Panoptic Mirror multiple times in a single turn or during the extra turns gained from Time Walk. This could involve using other cards that allow you to untap or reuse Panoptic Mirror, or cards that grant additional actions or turns. Without such interactions, you cannot achieve infinite turns solely with Panoptic Mirror and Time Walk. Therefore, while it is possible to gain extra turns, the conditions for infinite turns are not met without additional support.\",\n",
