      "3. **Explanation** – Panoptic Mirror allows you to copy a spell you have imprinted on it (in this case, Time Walk) and cast that copy for no cost during your upkeep. However, Time Walk only gives you an extra turn after the current one, and after you cast the imprinted Time Walk from the Mirror, it goes to exile again. You will need to pay its mana cost again to imprint and cast it a second time, which means you can only take one extra turn at a time, not infinite turns. You cannot repeatedly activate Panoptic Mirror without recurring the spell, which would require additional resources each time. Infinite turns would only be possible if you could continuously cast Time Walk without additional costs or conditions, which the Mirror does not facilitate.  \n",
      "4. **Sources** – Comprehensive Rules, specifically rule 113.4c regarding Time Walk: “Target player takes an extra turn after this one.” Also, Panoptic Mirror’s activation rules clarify that you have to cast the spell from the Mirror for it to work each time.\n"

However, if you cast Bounce Off on your 2/2 creature after it's been declared as a blocker, the attacking creature will already have assigned damage during the combat damage step before the 2/2 creature returns to your hand. The trample mechanic dictates that if the attacker assigns lethal damage to the blocker (which it will, even if it’s only there temporarily), any additional damage is dealt to the defending player. Since the creature is still there for the damage assignment, you will take the remaining damage from the attacking creature after the lethal damage requirement has been met.\n",

If you cast **Bounce Off** on the 2/2 creature, it will be returned to your hand before combat damage is assigned. According to the rules of combat, once a creature is declared as a blocker and is then removed from the battlefield (in this case, by being bounced to your hand), the attack still goes through and damage is dealt to you. The rules specify that combat damage is assigned based on which creatures are still on the battlefield for that damage step, and since the defending creature is no longer there to absorb damage, the 8/8 creature will deal its full damage to you. \n",

      "1. **TL;DR** – Yes, you can sacrifice one of the creatures after it is assigned lethal damage to activate an ability; however, if it is sacrificed before state-based actions are checked, the other creature will still die from lethal damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Explanation** – In Magic: The Gathering, when two 3/3 creatures deal damage to each other in combat, any creature that receives damage equal to or greater than its toughness is considered to have lethal damage. After the combat damage is dealt, state-based actions are checked, and any creature with lethal damage will be put into the graveyard. However, if you have an ability that allows you to sacrifice a creature (for example, an activated ability on another card that allows you to sacrifice a creature), you can choose to use that ability after damage has been dealt but before state-based actions are fully resolved. In that scenario, if you sacrifice your creature after it has received damage (but before it goes to the graveyard), it will not have any effect on whether the other creature survives since the lethal damage has already been assigned. The second creature, if it has also been assigned lethal damage, will still go to the graveyard when state-based actions are checked. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sources** – The relevant rule here is 704.5g (if a creature has been dealt damage equal to its toughness, it is put into the graveyard as a state-based action).
