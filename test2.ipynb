      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, you can keep all the cards you draw.\n",
      "full_explanation:  In Magic: The Gathering, the maximum hand size is typically seven cards at the end of your turn. However, if you draw more than seven cards and there are no effects limiting your hand size, you can keep all the cards you have drawn. The rule regarding hand size states that you must discard down to your maximum hand size only during the cleanup step of your turn. Therefore, if you draw more than seven cards during your turn, you can hold onto them until the cleanup step, at which point you would need to discard down to seven if you have more than that. Since you specified that no other effects limit your hand size, you are free to keep all the cards you have drawn until that cleanup step occurs.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, a mana ability can be used by tapping a land to generate mana, and it cannot be responded to.\n",
      "full_explanation:  When you tap a land for mana, you activate a mana ability. This ability resolves immediately and does not use the stack, meaning that it cannot be responded to by other players. For example, tapping a Forest generates one green mana. Since mana abilities resolve immediately, you can use the mana generated right away to pay for costs of spells or abilities. The turn structure allows you to activate mana abilities during your main phases when you have priority, but no other player can respond to the activation of a mana ability.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, a creature that phases out and then back in loses summoning sickness.\n",
      "full_explanation:  When a creature phases out, it is treated as though it does not exist on the battlefield. This means that it is not considered to be in play and does not have any effects or statuses, including summoning sickness. When the creature phases back in, it is considered a new object on the battlefield. According to the rules, a creature can only attack or use activated abilities with the tap symbol if it has been under its controller's control since the beginning of their most recent turn. Since the creature phased out, it effectively resets its status, and thus it does not have summoning sickness when it phases back in.\n",

It can’t attack or block, and it can’t activate any of its abilities. When it phases in, it returns to the battlefield as a new object.\"\n",

      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, card text generally takes precedence over the rules.\n",
      "full_explanation:  Yes, the principle that 'card text overrides rules' means that the specific text on a card will take precedence over the general rules of Magic: The Gathering. This is a fundamental aspect of the game, as it allows for unique interactions and abilities that may not be covered by the general rules. For example, if a card has an ability that contradicts a general rule, the ability on the card will apply instead. This is outlined in the Comprehensive Rules, specifically in rule 613.1, which states that the text of a card takes precedence over the rules of the game. Therefore, if there is a conflict between a card's text and the rules, the card's text will always win.\n",

      "correct answer:  Yes\n",
      "reworded question:  Do the continuous effects from Painter's Servant persist after ability-removal effects are applied?\n",
      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, the effects from Painter's Servant do not remain after ability-removal effects are applied.\n",
      "full_explanation:  Painter's Servant's ability changes the color of all cards that aren't on the battlefield, spells, and permanents, and this effect is applied in layer 6. However, ability-removal effects are applied in layer 3, which means they can overwrite the effects of Painter's Servant. If an ability that removes Painter's Servant's effect is applied, the color change it caused will no longer persist. Therefore, the color change will only remain until an effect that removes the ability of Painter's Servant is applied. This means that once the ability is removed, the affected objects revert to their original colors unless another effect changes their colors again.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, a creature entering the battlefield tapped does not affect its summoning sickness status.\n",
      "full_explanation:  Summoning sickness is a term used to describe the restriction that prevents a creature from attacking or using abilities that require tapping if it has not been under your control since the beginning of your most recent turn. A creature that enters the battlefield tapped still has summoning sickness if it has not been under your control since the beginning of your turn. The fact that it enters tapped does not change its status regarding summoning sickness; it simply cannot attack or use tap abilities until it has been under your control for a full turn cycle.\n",
      "sources:  CR 506.2: \"A creature that has been under your control since the beginning of your turn can attack and activate its abilities that require tapping. A creature that has not been under your control since the beginning of your turn has summoning sickness.\"\n",

      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, a player can concede the game at any time.\n",
      "full_explanation:  In Magic: The Gathering, a player may concede the game at any point during their turn or their opponent's turn. When a player concedes, they are effectively choosing to lose the game, and this action ends the current game immediately. The game state is updated to reflect that the conceding player has lost, and the other player is declared the winner. This is a voluntary action and does not require any specific conditions to be met. The rules governing this are found in the Comprehensive Rules, specifically CR 104.3, which states that a player may concede the game at any time. Once a player concedes, the game ends, and any remaining actions or effects are no longer relevant.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, Rest in Peace does not prevent enter-the-battlefield triggers.\n",
      "full_explanation:  Rest in Peace has a replacement effect that exiles cards that would go to the graveyard instead. However, this does not affect abilities that trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. When a card with an enter-the-battlefield trigger enters the battlefield, that trigger will still go on the stack regardless of Rest in Peace's effect. The replacement effect only applies to cards that would be put into a graveyard, not to the triggering of abilities when a card enters the battlefield. Therefore, any enter-the-battlefield triggers will still occur as normal.\n",
      "sources:  CR 603.6: \"A replacement effect modifies how an event occurs. It doesn’t prevent the event from happening.\"\n",

      "reworded question:  Does shroud prevent a permanent's controller from targeting it with their own spells or abilities?\n",
      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, shroud does not prevent a permanent's controller from targeting it with their own spells or abilities.\n",
      "full_explanation:  Shroud is an ability that states, \"This permanent can't be the target of spells or abilities you control.\" This means that while the permanent cannot be targeted by spells or abilities controlled by other players, the controller of the permanent can still target it with their own spells or abilities. The key distinction here is that the term 'you control' refers to the spells or abilities, not the permanent itself. Therefore, the controller is allowed to target their own permanent with spells or abilities they control, as they are not restricted by shroud in this case. This aligns with the rules regarding targeting and the distinction between controlling a permanent and controlling the spells or abilities that target it.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  yes\n",
      "short_answer:  Yes, players can activate abilities or cast spells during the untap step if those abilities or spells specifically allow it.\n",
      "full_explanation:  While the primary action during the untap step is to untap all tapped permanents that the active player controls, players can still activate abilities or cast spells if those abilities or spells allow it. For example, if a player has a triggered ability that activates during the untap step, or if they have an instant spell they wish to cast, they can do so. The untap step is part of the beginning phase of a turn, and while it does not allow for general spell casting or ability activation, it does not prevent players from responding to triggered abilities or casting spells that are specifically allowed. Therefore, if a player has an ability that triggers during this step, they can respond to it or activate other abilities as permitted by the game rules.\n",
      "sources:  CR 500.2: \"The untap step is the first step of the beginning phase. During this step, the active player untaps all of their tapped permanents. Players may activate abilities or cast spells if those abilities or spells specifically allow it.\"\n",

      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, the player does not lose the game.\n",
      "full_explanation:  In Magic: The Gathering, state-based actions are checked whenever a player would receive priority, which includes after a spell or ability resolves. If a player has 0 life and gains life simultaneously from an effect, the game checks for state-based actions after the life gain occurs. Since the player now has a positive life total, they do not lose the game. The key point is that state-based actions are checked after the life gain resolves, preventing the loss condition from applying.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, you cannot get infinite turns by imprinting Time Walk on Panoptic Mirror.\n",
      "full_explanation:  When you imprint Time Walk on Panoptic Mirror, you can use its ability to copy Time Walk during your upkeep. However, the effect of Time Walk allows you to take only one extra turn after the current one. After you take that extra turn, you will not have another Time Walk available to copy unless you imprint another card. The ability of Panoptic Mirror only triggers once each upkeep, and you cannot create an infinite loop with just one instance of Time Walk. Therefore, while you can take an extra turn, it does not lead to infinite turns.\n",

      "single_word_answer:  no\n",
      "short_answer:  No, you cannot play Aven Interrupter to counter Flashfreeze after it has been cast.\n",
      "full_explanation:  When you cast Kozilek's Predator, it goes onto the stack. Your opponent then responds by casting Flashfreeze to counter your Kozilek's Predator. At this point, Flashfreeze is on the stack, and you cannot play Aven Interrupter in response to Flashfreeze because Aven Interrupter's ability requires it to enter the battlefield and exile a spell as it resolves. Since Flashfreeze is already resolving to counter your spell, you cannot intervene with Aven Interrupter. Once Flashfreeze resolves, Kozilek's Predator will be countered and sent to the graveyard, and you will not have the opportunity to play Aven Interrupter to affect that interaction.\n",

This ability allows you to gain control of a target permanent until end of turn and untap that permanent. However, the token created by Kiki-Jiki will be sacrificed at the end of the turn. Since Kiki-Jiki's ability requires it to tap to create the token, it will be tapped when you create the token. Therefore, you cannot use Kiki-Jiki again in the same turn to create another token, as it will be tapped and unable to activate its ability again until it is untapped in a future turn.
